The mod adds a new detective guild building in the Slums area, which can become an additional stronghold for a player of any class - if he manages to save the guild from bankruptcy in two weeks of game time.
The quest will begin after meeting an unusual new character in the Council of Six building in the Government District.

What awaits you is the following:
- new area with two floors (maps were created by Gorion);
- a new stronghold that will generate income;
- new non-joinable characters;
- one long quest to get a guild;
- small quests and incidents in the guild itself (to get some of them, you need to return to the building later);
- a small episode in ToB, if the guild was obtained in SoA.;
- several new items (mostly books, notes and things needed for the plot or just for immersion in history)

COMPATIBILITY:
On BG2EE, EET the mod works by default. On the "classic" version of the game (BG2, BGT) the mod will install only if the Infinity Animations mod is previously installed (since it requires bugbear animation in the game).
The mod should be compatible with any other mods, but conflicts with mods that change Mae'Var's guild are possible - "NPC Strongholds", "D0 Questpack (Additional Shadow Thieves Content component)", "Expanded Thief Stronghold". Sharing with them is at your own risk.

CROSS-MOD CONTENT:
There are some cross-mod character quotes from the following mods (all necessary permissions have been obtained):
- "BG1 NPC in SoA&ToB" (Smiling Imp & Arcanecoast Team)
- Xan, Coran and Tiax mods (Kulyok)

- SilverStar (Seifer & Davide Carta)

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS

A: It will, but only in conjunction with the Infinity Animations mod.

Q:Will new quests be added for the guild?
A:An expansion of the mod is planned, if the coder has free time. We can't promise anything yet.
