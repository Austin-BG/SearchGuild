// Detective Huey
@0 = ~你好，我的<PRO_LADYLORD>。~
@1 = ~你现在正在调查什么案子，Huey？~
@2 = ~有人——或者某物——正在药铺里更换药品标签。仅仅这周，就有三位贵族因为破坏行为，收到了泻药而不是咳嗽药！~
@3 = ~城外住着一位治疗师，她已经有一个月没有消息了。有人让我去查看这位老妇人的情况。我马上就要出发了。~
@4 = ~在权杖区有一位失明的乞丐，他突然开始预测未来。当地的牧师认为他是个骗子，让我跟踪他。~
@5 = ~有一个戴着面具的神秘男子拯救了镇民并惩罚了罪犯。城市守卫让我们找到他，以便对他进行奖励。~
@6 = ~据说贫民窟里有一个食人者。守卫很少进入那个区域，但最近当一名女子被啃食后的残骸在下水道中被发现时，他们不得不进去调查。~

// Detective Dewey
@7 = ~问候，我的<PRO_LADYLORD>。~
@8 = ~你现在正在调查什么案件，德怀？~
@9 = ~昨天，一个屠夫店老板在他的家中被毒死了。虽然还没有人公开谈论这件事，但似乎我应该去查看一下药剂师——邻居们注意到他和屠夫的妻子……呃，屠夫的遗孀有着奇怪的亲密关系。~
@10 = ~一位政府官员怀疑文员中有一个Riatavin间谍。我正在监视一个嫌疑人，但到目前为止还没有发现任何线索。~
@11 = ~一个年轻的法师学徒从他的导师那里偷了一件隐形斗篷，并偷偷溜进了他心爱的贵族之家。但他遇到了一个守卫魔像，于是逃跑了，不幸的斗篷被魔像抓在手里。魔像当然没有告诉主人什么，但斗篷必须归还，否则年轻人会有麻烦。他愿意把所有的积蓄都给我们，只要我们帮助他。~
@12 = ~森林精灵的箭似乎被赋予了某种特殊的魔法，因为它们命中目标的次数如此之多。卫队的负责人雇用我们去研究它们的秘密。~
@13 = ~一位当地艺术家雇用我们去获取一种特殊的粉末，这种粉末能让人类和动物在一段时间内保持一个姿势不动。我正在走访镇上的每一个商人以找到它。~

// Detective Louie
@14 = ~你好，长官。~
@15 = ~你现在正在调查什么案件，路易？~
@16 = ~有些生物开始在面包师的仓库里吃面粉。起初大家都以为是老鼠，但我掀开覆盖仓库地板的木板，发现了一个足够一个成年人挤过去的洞。老鼠做不到这一点。~
@17 = ~理发师说，每个人都在拿着+1和+2的剑和棍棒跑来跑去，而他需要一把+1的剪刀。如果我能为他找到一些，他会慷慨地付钱。~
@18 = ~贫民窟的一个酿酒师说，有人在散布谣言，说他在啤酒里掺了驴尿。我正在努力找出幕后黑手。我想知道他为什么要这么做。~
@19 = ~有人从一个蜡烛商的店里偷走了一车烛台。我所拥有的只是一个小偷踩在一块掉落的蜡上的脚印。~
@20 = ~政府区的巴尔莫尔勋爵向我们寻求帮助。一些戴着黑面具的无赖在他家的保姆带他出去散步时绑架了他的儿子。当然，巴尔莫尔勋爵认为保姆只是失去了孩子的踪迹，并编造了关于强盗的故事。~

@99 = ~有很多任务。嗯，比如……~
@100 = ~我就是过来打个招呼，我现在得走了。~
@101 = ~祝你好运！~
@102 = ~好的，回头见。~
@103 = ~那我回去忙我的事了。~

// Quest about the dog Orgot
@104 = ~祝你有个美好的一天，<CHARNAME>。我们有一个订单，相当不寻常……~
@105 = ~你也是，你好吗？~
@106 = ~怎么了，努马？~
@107 = ~哦，只是……工作太多了。~
@108 = ~多休息休息。你看起来很累。~
@109 = ~这很好。你工作越多，挣得就越多。~
@110 = ~我们已经雇了侦探，事情现在应该会轻松些了。~
@111 = ~当然，<PRO_SIRMAAM>。~
@112 = ~总之，我们客户的狗丢了，我们需要找到它。~
@113 = ~我加入，我爱狗！~
@114 = ~当蒂亚克斯成为托瑞尔的统治者时，他将禁止所有狗大声吠叫！~
@115 = ~而且，在蒂亚克斯智者的统治下，所有狗都将被迫携带袋子，并且自己清理！~
@116 = ~是的，那将是一个非常明智的决定，蒂亚克斯。你是个好孩子。但那不是现在的问题。~
@117 = ~问题是，这只狗，一只名叫苏丹的白色雄性，属于克劳默顿家族的最小的儿子，这是一个有影响力的马匹饲养者和商人。他们的种马场为安姆的一半和整个泰斯提供马匹。他们说有某种恶魔附身在狗身上。~
@118 = ~狗跑掉多久了？~
@119 = ~嗯，它进来了又进来。有了恶魔在里面，狗应该能更好地守卫房子，我想。~
@120 = ~它为什么跑掉了？那些吝啬的有钱人没有好好喂它？~
@121 = ~今天早上。它咬了一个仆人就跑了。如果我们把它活着带回来，没有恶魔在里面，他们会付七百个硬币。如果是死的，他们会付两百个硬币。~
@122 = ~也许，但狗今天早上跑了。咬了一个仆人就跑了。如果我们把它活着带回来，没有恶魔在里面，他们会付七百个硬币。如果是死的，他们会付两百个硬币。~
@123 = ~不，他们喂得很好，但发生了一些奇怪的事情。它今天早上跑了。咬了仆人就跑了。如果我们把它活着带回来，没有恶魔在里面，他们会付七百个硬币。如果是死的，他们会付两百个硬币。~
@124 = ~我们还知道些什么？~
@125 = ~没有足够的信息来搜寻。我们不能在阿斯卡特拉到处跑，在每个角落寻找狗。~
@126 = ~据说苏丹在逃跑之前咆哮了拉坦德的名字。~
@127 = ~咆哮？！拉坦德和这有什么关系？真是胡说八道！~
@128 = ~一只会说话的狗？这是我们最不需要的东西。他的主人没有喝醉，你确定吗？~
@129 = ~至少他的主人是这样告诉我的。~
@130 = ~不，他来这里的时候很清醒。~
@131 = ~这里有人知道如何进行驱魔吗？或者我们应该像往常一样当场解决？尽管我们早就习惯了。~
@132 = ~看起来我们得进行一次驱魔了。~
@133 = ~我想知道该去哪里找这只狗。我得好好想想。~
@134 = ~我不喜欢这个任务了。我不做了。告诉他们我们拒绝。~
@135 = ~决定权在你，<PRO_SIRMAAM>。~
@136 = ~如果狗和拉坦德有什么关联，我会从这位神的神殿开始寻找。但这只是我的猜测。~
@137 = ~如你所说，<PRO_SIRMAAM>。~
@138 = ~*你看到一只被神殿守卫包围的大型白色狗。从狗嘴里发出的声音确实令人毛骨悚然。你只能费力地把它们拼凑成连贯的言语*~
@139 = ~回答我，人类：当你的拉坦德完成他的神迹时，他会在晚上焚烧那些不受欢迎的人吗？就像我被告知的那样吗？~
@140 = ~快从这里跑开，好人。你看到这个生物了吗？它被附身了！~
@141 = ~我真心相信拉坦德！帮帮我，我发誓以黎明之名，我会给你带来一个年轻、美丽的精灵处女，让你满足你的欲望和对鲜血的渴望！就像拉坦德的仆人所做的那样。~
@142 = ~多么令人厌恶的亵渎神明！~
@143 = ~我们必须保护神殿！杀了他！~
@144 = ~*干预* 别动！我会处理他！~
@145 = ~*不干预* ~
@146 = ~你确定吗，<PRO_SIRMAAM>? 这东西看起来很危险。~
@147 = ~没关系，我们会应付的。这只狗属于克劳默顿家族的成员，我们被派来抓它。我会试着把恶魔赶出狗的身体。然而，如果出了什么问题，要保持警惕。~
@148 = ~我不确定，但如果我们成功了，我们会得到丰厚的报酬。我会试试。~
@149 = ~其实你说得对。这只狗太可怕了，杀了它！~
@150 = ~驱魔是一件非常困难的事情。但既然你觉得合适，<PRO_SIRMAAM>。如果它攻击，我们会来帮忙。~
@151 = ~报出你的身份，恶魔！~
@152 = ~你想要什么，恶魔？~
@153 = ~嘿，狗！想要香肠吗？~
@154 = ~我改变主意了。杀了那只狗！~
@155 = ~深渊之神，我真的附身在一只狗身上了吗？！我有……跳蚤！不！不！！！~
@156 = ~*狗——或者更准确地说，狗体内的恶魔——在哭泣* 我还这么年轻，我不想死！我才一百一十岁！~
@157 = ~运气不好，伙计……这是怎么发生的？而且你为什么需要拉坦德？~
@158 = ~我要从一个流浪者那里买一个项圈，一个拉坦德的牧师。他在主位面说了许多关于他那嗜血的神的事情。我感兴趣了！！然后牧师给我戴上了项圈——我就在这里了！！项圈在我身上！我拿不下来！~
@159 = ~*狗用爪子抓项圈，看起来很无助*~
@160 = ~所以你是通过传送门被召唤过来的？然后附身在最近的生物身上。现在一切都清楚了。除了地狱里的那个牧师。他似乎用项圈引诱了你，还玩得很开心。你怎么会不知道拉坦德是谁？~
@161 = ~所以这都是项圈的问题。我不明白那个牧师为什么要这么做。要怎么做才能把你从狗的身体里赶出去？~
@162 = ~好问题。我该怎么做才能把你从狗的身体里赶出去？~
@163 = ~*狗显然很尴尬，甚至用爪子捂住它的口鼻* 我的教育被忽视了，是的！但我一出来就要把那个牧师撕成碎片！你知道怎么帮忙吗，<PRO_RACE>!?~
@164 = ~你怎么会不知道拉坦德是谁？~
@165 = ~你必须说出附身恶魔的名字。~
@166 = ~那么计划就是这样。既然项圈是一个传送门，我们将利用它。我会把你赶走，并立即将你送回你的家乡，以你真正的形态。ORGOT!~
@167 = ~那么听我说！*你大声而清晰地说出恶魔的名字*：ORGOT!~
@168 = ~ORGOT!~
@169 = ~汪！*狗自信地跑回家*~
@170 = ~干得好，<PRO_SIRMAAM>！~
@171 = ~我不会在城里到处跑去找狗。我有更重要的事情要做。~
@172 = ~这和我有什么关系？相信其中一个工人。~
@173 = ~抱歉，但这是一项愚蠢的任务，我不会做。告诉他们我们拒绝。~
@174 = ~你这个恶魔发生了什么？~
@175 = ~我的名字是ORRGOT！~
@176 = ~*你说出这个名字，同时解开狗的项圈*~

// Mister Matty's Quest
@177 = ~*公会的门开了，一个还没有长胡子的年轻侏儒*走进了走廊~
@178 = ~你好。~
@179 = ~欢迎来到侦探公会。我能帮你什么吗？~
@180 = ~你也你好。你想要什么？~
@181 = ~快说！我们很赶时间！~
@182 = ~你是卖报纸的男孩吗？把它们放在桌子上。这是你的金币。现在走开。~
@183 = ~对我来说，<PRO_SIRMAAM> <CHARNAME>，这是我的荣幸。~
@184 = ~什么？不，我不卖报纸。我是来谈生意的。~
@185 = ~你好，南斯特罗普先生。~
@186 = ~你好，贝斯 - 丁先生。~
@187 = ~请允许我自我介绍一下。我是马蒂亚斯·南斯特罗普，司法顾问。*那个没长胡子的矮人脸红了*。我来找你们是为了一个与我的业务——海事法——相关的相当微妙的问题。我需要获取一份非常重要的文件。~
@188 = ~你说“获取”？你为什么决定来找我们帮忙呢？~
@189 = ~你自己为什么不去获取呢？你需要我们干什么？~
@190 = ~我感觉这里有什么非法的事情正在进行？你不会是把我们和盗贼公会搞混了吧，对吧？~
@191 = ~你的公会是贝斯 - 丁先生推荐给我的，<PRO_SIRMAAM>。我在大学有幸听过贝斯 - 丁先生的讲座。是关于大学法的课程。~
@192 = ~哦，那都是很久以前的事了。~
@193 = ~先生，那是五年前的事了。而且让我告诉你，你的讲座是最有趣的。我至今仍愉快地记得它们。~
@194 = ~谢谢，马蒂亚斯先生。听到这个很高兴。~
@195 = ~顾问，你从大学毕业多久了？~
@196 = ~所以你是学生，和努马一起学习过？我明白了。~
@197 = ~一个月前，<PRO_SIRMAAM>，我在获得学士学位后毕业了。遗憾的是，我无法继续深造。~
@198 = ~是这样吗？如果不是秘密的话，为什么呢？~
@199 = ~我明白了。你是个穷学生，无法进入下一个阶段。~
@200 = ~这和你来这里要办的事有什么关系吗？我们时间不多了。~
@201 = ~这都是因为我与一位教授发生了分歧。我们在阿姆的奴隶制问题上意见不合……也许我在争论中过于严厉了。我被允许获得我的毕业证书，但我不得不放弃获得硕士袍子的希望。~
@202 = ~你也讨厌奴隶制吗？是时候结束它了。~
@203 = ~奴隶制有什么不对的？~
@204 = ~奴隶制一直存在，只要它能带来收入，就会一直存在。~
@205 = ~在我看来，奴隶制是一项伟大的生意，非常有利可图！~
@206 = ~*矮人变得激动起来* 我觉得我们不需要奴隶。你和我，<PRO_SIRMAAM>，正处于一个伟大的贸易国家的中心，商品生产的中心，也是费伦最大的中心之一。这些可怜的家伙，我问你，他们的低质量、低效率的劳动有什么好处？奴隶贸易在周围滋生贫困，让无赖发财，还使我们作为一个国家蒙羞！~
@207 = ~*矮人逐渐平静下来* 哦，<PRO_SIRMAAM>，请原谅我的急躁。我仍然无法平静地看待这件事。~
@208 = ~阿姆的一切都是为了赚钱。只要奴隶有利可图，情况恐怕就不会改变。~
@209 = ~在我看来，这是错误的政策，<PRO_SIRMAAM>。~
@210 = ~我不关心政治。~
@211 = ~目前阿姆的政策是什么？在自由方面，比如？~
@212 = ~请允许我这样说，<PRO_SIRMAAM>，如果你不参与政治，那么总有一天政治会“参与”你。几千年的费伦历史已经无可辩驳地证明，这种不干预的态度会导致许多灾难。~
@213 = ~*顾问压低声音* 当然，现在阿姆很少有人支持议会制和自由，但情况正在逐渐好转。~
@214 = ~没有人确切知道我们到底是什么样的政治制度。我会将其定义为贸易精英制，商人和其他富有的公民享有广泛的权力。~
@215 = ~你说“精英制”，先生！请允许我指出……~
@216 = ~*一些重要而晦涩的词汇，如“大庄园”和“准合同”，开始在空中威胁性地徘徊，你决定还是结束这场突然爆发的法律争论，以防万一。然而，被阿姆法律的黑暗中飞蛾扑火般追求真理的热情所吸引，顾问们争论不休，完全忘记了你。*~
@217 = ~嗯！顾问们？~
@218 = ~抱歉，<PRO_SIRMAAM>，我有点走神了。让我言归正传。~
@219 = ~我需要拿到一份副本——文件的第三份副本。只要看一眼，然后就归还。~
@220 = ~文件里有什么？~
@221 = ~你为什么需要它？~
@222 = ~你看，<PRO_SIRMAAM>，当和巴尔德之门关系紧张的时候，六人议会命令商人公会拨出部分商船作为预备——用于快速运输部队和补给。在强制停运期间，船只由阿姆出资进行了维修和重新装备。现在战争的威胁已经过去，贸易又恢复了速度，这整个舰队——二十艘船，<PRO_SIRMAAM>！——已经驶向了马兹提卡和剑湾的港口。~
@223 = ~我不能向你透露我的雇主是谁。但我可以暗示，他们对船只在停运期间实际完成的工作和后来在羊皮纸上反映的内容之间的差异感兴趣。~
@224 = ~所以有人把“节省下来”的差额装进了自己的口袋？~
@225 = ~那又怎样？我不明白这一切到底是怎么回事。~
@226 = ~完全正确，<PRO_SIRMAAM>。~
@227 = ~我们说的是复式记账条目。两份副本很可能已经被销毁了，但第三份，秘密重写的，现在保存在船上。关于羊皮纸的信息是绝对可靠的。~
@228 = ~这是你的第一起案件，如果我没猜错的话？~
@229 = ~*矮人脸红了* 是的，这是我第一起案件，我决定我可以处理它！也许，嗯，我接手这个案子太有野心了。~
@230 = ~一点也不，南斯特罗普先生，你能接手真是太好了。有时候最好从大案子开始。那么，这艘船是什么？~
@231 = ~双桅帆船“粉红狐狸号”，就在阿斯卡特拉港。它像墓碑一样古老，但仍然漂浮着。全体船员都在岸上。我们必须悄悄进行，不引起注意。~
@232 = ~好的。关于报酬。这将花费九百个硬币，先付一半。你觉得合适吗？~
@233 = ~一个合理的价格，<PRO_SIRMAAM>。请。*矮人把金币递给你*~
@234 = ~不幸的是，公会无法接受你的案子，南斯特罗普先生。它，嗯，太像盗窃了，不是我们的专长。请原谅。~
@235 = ~我明白了。好吧，打扰了，公会会长。我希望这里所说的一切将严格保密。再见，先生们。~
@236 = ~那么我们别磨蹭了。我们去码头，看看这艘船是如何守卫的，所有的进出口。我们会偷走文件，给你，然后把羊皮纸放回原处。~
@237 = ~我只需要一分钟就能记住内容。~
@238 = ~*你和南斯特罗普先生偷偷溜进了“粉红狐狸号”的货舱，因为船员们正在港口的酒馆里寻欢作乐*~
@239 = ~这就是你要找的羊皮纸吗，马蒂？~
@240 = ~是的，就是它。谢谢。让我看看……~
@241 = ~嗯哼，贿赂，更多的贿赂，一瓶“龙之力”药水，送给造船师的十盎司龙涎香作为对琥珀女神的供品，两名卡拉姆珊男孩的服务，最后，来自女儿之家的一个矮人的“特别”按摩！所有的金币都花在这上面了！~
@242 = ~你听到脚步声了吗？我们应该走了。~
@243 = ~是的，我们走。我完成了。~
@244 = ~谢谢，<PRO_SIRMAAM>。这是剩下的报酬，如约而至。来找你真是太好了！~
@245 = ~嘿，我还在呢！我们该谈正事了，不是吗？~
@246 = ~我想我们应该和“粉红狐狸号”的一些水手谈谈，他们应该在码头附近。也许其中一个人可以帮助我们上船，如果我们付钱或者用某种方式说服他们。~
@247 = ~*你看到一个水手，他的脸被伤疤覆盖，被风吹得粗糙不堪*。陆地上的软蛋，你想要什么？~
@248 = ~你碰巧是“粉红狐狸号”的人吗？我需要这艘船上的人。~
@249 = ~没错，九层地狱！我在“粉红狐狸号”上已经一年了。~
@250 = ~我马上就要走了，别管我。~
@251 = ~你似乎对这件事不太高兴？~
@252 = ~你觉得这艘船的服务怎么样？~
@253 = ~我需要上这艘船。更确切地说，进入货舱。你会帮忙吗？~
@254 = ~去他的船！我加入的时候本希望赚一笔大钱，但这艘船显然被诅咒了。这艘船除了失败什么都没有——我的口袋还是破的。~
@255 = ~为什么？嗯，我才不在乎你或者这艘船呢。~
@256 = ~我不知道你为什么要偷偷溜进货舱，但我猜那不是为了给某个女人留下好印象。~
@257 = ~反正我也打算辞职，所以我没什么可失去的。船员都在岸上，在酒馆里。我可以帮你通过哨兵。但你打算用什么来回报我呢，嗯？~
@258 = ~我有一个钱袋，你可能会用得上。里面有20个金币，你觉得怎么样？~
@259 = ~我有一个钱袋，你可能会用得上。里面有100个金币，你觉得怎么样？~
@260 = ~那么100个金币怎么样？~
@261 = ~把钱给我。~
@262 = ~我没有更多的钱了。~
@263 = ~那你等有钱了再来吧！我们的谈话结束了！~
@264 = ~那么，你为我们带来了100个金币吗？~
@265 = ~是的，给你。~
@266 = ~还没有。~
@267 = ~好的。我会安排好一切。跟我来。~
@268 = ~我可以……用其他方式付钱给你。~
@269 = ~你是个美人，嘿嘿！好吧，我在航行中错过了女人的爱抚，而你正合适。但要先付钱。拐角处有个僻静的地方。没人会看到我们。~
@270 = ~当然，我在航行中错过了女人的爱抚，但你太丑了，连我都不想要。抱歉，没有个人恩怨。~
@271 = ~你干得不错，女孩！这是公平的报酬。我也会信守承诺的。~
@272 = ~如果我告诉你，如果你拒绝，我会杀了你呢？~
@273 = ~好吧，好吧。我能看出来你是认真的，而且你很有力量。~
@274 = ~啊哈哈！你在开玩笑吗？我只要用小指头就能把你打倒在地！~
@275 = ~我有一些守卫朋友。如果你不帮我，你会被逮捕的。~
@276 = ~他们会以什么理由逮捕我呢，我想知道？如果我告诉他们你试图潜入别人的船，他们可能会逮捕你。嘿嘿。还有别的建议吗？~
@277 = ~那太好了，滚开吧。~
@278 = ~20个金币？我在酒馆里花在妓女身上的钱都比这多！不，我的朋友。~

// "Honey Gambit"
@279 = ~*一个头发蓬乱的滑稽小矮人站在公会大厅里，不停地挪动着脚步。他显然是急急忙忙赶来的。*~
@280 = ~你好，我的<PRO_LADYLORD>。我叫弗罗多·南瓜。我来找你们是有重要，非常重要的事情。~
@281 = ~我需要侦探公会的服务。听说你们的生意蒸蒸日上，你们一定能帮到我。~
@282 = ~说说你的问题，然后我们再决定。~
@283 = ~又是个小矮人。努马，我们的客户都是小矮人吗？~
@284 = ~我没时间听你讲，小矮人。我们的客户太多了，不能再接新的任务了。~
@285 = ~我……明白了，我的<PRO_LADYLORD>。打扰了，再见。~
@286 = ~龙餐厅的糕点师被解雇了，所以我决定去那里应聘。但我的竞争对手，那个邪恶的糕点师小矮人穆德里克，偷走了我家传的果酱派配方。这个贼也想在那里找工作。我不知道他是怎么做到的，但配方就是从我的口袋里被偷走的，就在沃金长廊上，光天化日之下！当时我只是一时分心，正在挑选香料……*小矮人悲伤地叹了口气*~
@287 = ~这只是巧合，我觉得。我们听听他说什么吧。~
@288 = ~你确定是你的竞争对手偷了配方吗？~
@289 = ~你凭什么认为是穆德里克偷了你的配方？~
@290 = ~不，我没看到贼。但肯定是穆德里克干的！龙餐厅的主厨，甜齿女士，决定在我们俩都来应聘的时候，搞一场竞争。~
@291 = ~谁要是能做出最好的甜派或蛋糕，谁就能得到糕点师的职位。我不小心吹嘘了我家传的“果冻猪”配方，甚至还拿出了写有配方的卷轴。就是那时候贼注意到我把配方放在哪个口袋里了。~
@292 = ~嗯，所以你没有任何偷窃的证据？那你想要我们帮你做什么，弗罗多先生？毕竟，把配方拿回来也没意义，而且根据你的说法，抓他偷窃也行不通。仅凭你的怀疑是不足以拘留这位智者先生的。~
@293 = ~你忘了，小矮人。我们怎么抓你的智者先生呢，如果他身上什么都没有的话？守卫不会听我们的，他们要证据或者供词。~
@294 = ~嗯……这事儿有点复杂。如果没有确凿的证据，或者智者先生不承认他干的事，那我怀疑我能不能抓到他偷窃。~
@295 = ~我明白，当然，我的<PRO_LADYLORD>。但我有一个办法能阻止穆德里克使用我无与伦比的配方。我需要……我需要毁掉配方。~
@296 = ~毁掉？怎么个毁法？~
@297 = ~让穆德里克亲手毁了他的派，让他发誓。让他当着你们的面，以内贝尔恩的名义发誓，他不会在比赛中使用我的配方。作为回报，我会给他那个所谓的“秘密”果酱派配料。~
@298 = ~当这个骗子掉进他自己给我挖的坑里的时候，那可就太好笑了。~
@299 = ~那就是……你肯定穆德里克不会遵守誓言。也就是说，你的配料X会直接毁了他的派？~
@300 = ~你想出了一个聪明的主意，小矮人。一开始你说话的时候，我还以为你要搞诅咒，但现在我明白了？你要往哪儿带？所以你觉得穆德里克会违背誓言，自掘坟墓？你会利用他的贪婪赢得比赛……不错。~
@301 = ~没错。穆德里克违背誓言——小菜一碟。比赛定在今天，马上就要开始了。所以他没时间测试这个配料。你稍微配合我一下——稍后私下告诉他，你会对他的背誓睁一只眼闭一只眼，就说一百个金币。然后这个无赖肯定会买账的，我肯定，我的<PRO_LADYLORD>。~
@302 = ~好吧，你说服我了，小矮人。你欠我一百个金币。然后我还会从穆德里克那里再拿一百个。听着，如果不算秘密的话，这个“秘密配料”是什么？~
@303 = ~好吧，那我们说定了。我接下这个案子，收一百个金币。我还会从穆德里克那里再拿一百个。然后，他也不会回来要他的金币了，因为他的背誓和偷窃之名会让他的信誉扫地。听着，如果不算秘密的话，这个神秘配料是什么？~
@304 = ~不，我不接。我没必要插手两个糕点师的争执。抱歉，小矮人先生。~
@305 = ~不，小矮人，我不接这个案子。你找别人吧。~
@306 = ~好吧，那我们说定了，我的<PRO_LADYLORD>。*你们握手成交*~
@307 = ~说到配料，它就像羊长角一样毫无意义。是卡林珊蜂蜜。我听说在东方，他们用它代替糖来制作果酱。但你得小心地煮蜂蜜，用小火，按照正确的比例。~
@308 = ~你得用的蜂蜜量是糖的一半，否则果酱会太甜。我就靠这个东方的稀奇玩意儿来抓住智者先生。~
@309 = ~我们在哪儿能找到这个智者先生？~
@310 = ~我想在恩格的店里——他们有阿斯卡特拉最好的橙子。没有它们，你做不出好果酱。我们就在那儿碰头，我的<PRO_LADYLORD>。~
@311 = ~我希望我的胡子掉光！真是弗罗多本人。~
@312 = ~别再讲那些刻薄话了，智者先生。我来找你是要跟你谈一笔交易。~
@313 = ~那我就听听看。~
@314 = ~以内贝尔恩的名义发誓，今天比赛中不使用我的配方。然后我会原谅你偷配方的事，我还会告诉你果酱派的秘密配料。~
@315 = ~嗯，一个我肯定没偷的配方的秘密配料……你还想让我当着见证人的面发誓不使用我的配方？（笨蛋，我已经抄了两遍了！）~
@316 = ~就是这个意思。~
@317 = ~成交，弗罗多。我不做果酱猪了，我以黄金丘陵之主的名义发誓。我们会公平竞争……但你也要发誓不使用这个配方！现在，说出那个秘密配料。~
@318 = ~就这样吧。*小矮人握手成交*这是卡林珊蜂蜜。它的用量要比糖多三分之一。而且蜂蜜得加热到水沸点的一半。现在配方全告诉你了。但要是你打算违背誓言，可要小心！~
@319 = ~*穆德里克脸上露出一丝微笑，但很难猜出它背后是什么意思*~
@320 = ~要是你违背誓言，我就揪着你的衣领把你拖到守卫那里。你会作为骗子和背誓者在法律面前受审。告诉我，你会有麻烦吗？~
@321 = ~嘿，穆德里克，等等。看来弗罗多是个十足的傻瓜。我自己也不介意赚点钱。明白我的意思吗？~
@322 = ~不，<PRO_SIRMAAM>。我没有偷弗罗多先生的东西，我打算遵守我的誓言。~
@323 = ~那再见了。我的眼线会盯着比赛的。~
@324 = ~每次都一样。有人偷了东西还不承认。听着，智者先生：我不在乎你做啥。给我做一份猿猴脑子，配上美人鱼鳞片。那就是……~
@325 = ~要是你给我一百个金币，我就忘了你的誓言。你可以安心做你的果酱玩意儿，赢得比赛。~
@326 = ~好吧。这是你的金币……~
@327 = ~……我们从没见面。你可以走了。~
@328 = ~*智者先生离开了*~
@329 = ~嘿，智者先生，等等。你想赢得比赛，不是吗？向所有人证明，尤其是向你自己，你值得更多。你的“大城市”梦想呢，啊？是时候抓住机会了。我不会挡你的路，只要你给我一点报酬。比如说……~
@330 = ~说吧。我确实值得更多。这是两百个金币……~
@331 = ~抱歉，但答案是“不”，<PRO_SIRMAAM>。我没有偷弗罗多先生的东西，我打算遵守我的誓言。~
@332 = ~又是我，我的<PRO_LADYLORD>！好消息！穆德里克输掉了比赛，我得到了龙餐厅首席糕点师的职位！~
@333 = ~感谢你帮我搞了那个……小把戏。后会有期！我会向我的所有朋友推荐你们公会的！~
@334 = ~*穆德里克期待地看着你*~
@335 = ~……两百个金币。这是在阿斯卡特拉最好的餐厅之一担任糕点师的一点小费用。你觉得怎么样？~

@575 = ~(The door carefully opens, and a halfling girl looks into the room. She seems amazed by what she sees)~
@336 = ~O-o-oh! This vessel looks like it was pretty battered by the storm! An anchor down my throat if I find what I'm looking for here.~
@337 = ~Greetings, miss.~
@338 = ~What pleasant manners...~
@339 = ~Hello, little one.~
@340 = ~Hello, hello! Although I'm not a little one, I'm almost an adult.~
@341 = ~What kind of phenomenon is this?~
@342 = ~I'm not a phenomenon! I came here on business.~
@343 = ~Nordic, are you expecting guests?~
@344 = ~I doubt Mr. Nordic is expecting me, I don't know anyone here.~
@345 = ~What are you doing here, girl? Answer me!~
@346 = ~Why are you so rude? I came here on business.~
@347 = ~Anyway, let me introduce myself - my name is Rosie, Rosie Gold. And you, my<PRO_LADYLORD>, are probably the captain of this ship that crashed?~
@348 = ~Hm... actually, its captain never returned from his distant travels.~
@349 = ~Ah, that's what I thought! I'll have to look elsewhere for help.~
@350 = ~Wait. I really am the guild master now, so tell me what happened. Maybe we can help.~
@351 = ~Oh, finally a fair wind! Thank you, my<PRO_LADYLORD>! What's your name?~
@352 = ~Yeah, yeah. I don't think anyone here can help anyone anytime soon. This place has blown up like a bubble.~
@353 = ~Still... I'll tell you why I came. Just tell me how I should address you?~
@354 = ~I guess so. I'm now... um, the new captain of this ship.~
@355 = ~So you'll help me? Please!~
@356 = ~Tell me what happened, and I'll take a look.~
@357 = ~I don't know, I don't know...~
@358 = ~Ah, girl! Wherever I go, I'm the captain. What do you want?~
@359 = ~If you'll excuse me, I'll explain it all now.~
@360 = ~Okay. I'm listening.~
@361 = ~But... if this is a long story, I'll tell you later.~
@362 = ~My name is <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep.~
@363 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. Perhaps you've heard of the hero of Baldur's Gate?~
@364 = ~Oh, so you're <CHARNAME>! Anchor me... I mean, is that true? Ah, I've heard of you, my<PRO_LADYLORD>! There aren't many interesting stories in the world that a sailor's daughter doesn't know.~
@365 = ~I see... I thought you were a cabin boy from some ship.~
@366 = ~It looks like you want to follow in your father's footsteps.~
@367 = ~It's good that at least someone in this Athkatla of yours has heard of me. You're a sailor's daughter, then...~
@368 = ~I'm the adopted daughter of Peter Gold from the schooner "Swift". He's a human, not a halfling like me. Father doesn't like it when I talk like sailors, because, according to him, it's no use to landlubbers.~
@369 = ~Yes, although I adore the sea and ships, I still dream of becoming not a sailor, but a bard. A real one, not like now. For now, I sing in the evenings in taverns, mostly in "Sea Bounty", but sometimes in "Five Flagons". What I'm saying is that I've already asked everyone there, and no one could help me.~
@370 = ~What did you ask about, Rosie?~
@371 = ~Get to the point, girl.~
@372 = ~Oh, I knew it would be a never-ending story.~
@373 = ~Yeah, yeah, get to the point... Sorry, I'm worried. Besides, it's not every day you talk to heroes, huh? Anyway, dad's missing. It's been three days since Peter Gold came ashore, and his comrades from the "Quick" can confirm it, but... He doesn't show up at home. That's never happened.~
@374 = ~To anticipate some questions - dad couldn't have gone on a spree and forgotten about me. After returning from a voyage, he would sometimes have a few drinks at the "Gifts of the Sea", but then he would go straight home.~
@375 = ~Oh, come on, Rosie! Your dad has simply changed his habits and is carousing somewhere else. He'll sleep it off and come back.~
@376 = ~I'm telling you, no! Father couldn't do that. He loves me, even though I'm not his biological daughter. He couldn't...~
@377 = ~Okay, Rosie Gold, the detective guild will take on this case... for a suitable reward, of course.~
@378 = ~Something made him change his habit. Coincidence or circumstances. Okay, Rosie Gold, the detective guild will take on this case... for a suitable reward, of course.~
@379 = ~Oh, hurray! I could kiss you, my<PRO_LADYLORD> <CHARNAME>. Don't think twice, I'll pay for your efforts. I have savings.~
@380 = ~Or maybe your daddy has already gone to be fed to the sharks, and no one dares to tell you the truth?~
@381 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>! How cruel you are! This is not what I expected from a hero! I will go and find my father myself! Goodbye.~
@382 = ~Okay, let's figure it out... Maybe your father started a fight with someone when he went ashore? Or had a fight with someone while sailing and a fight broke out on land?~
@383 = ~I asked everyone I could... No one said anything like that. On the contrary, they said that everything was calm.~
@384 = ~What do you know about sailing? No miraculously discovered treasures or pirate maps?~
@385 = ~Nobody from the crew of the "Quick" mentioned any treasure. If my father had a dispute with someone, they would have told me.~
@386 = ~So you looked for your father in the "Sea Bounty" and "Five Flagons", and all in vain?~
@387 = ~Yes, no one saw him there.~
@388 = ~I don't want to upset you, Rosie, but you understand that anything could have happened. Bandits, slave traders, a woman, finally... Did your father have a woman?~
@389 = ~I-I don't know... he didn't tell me. Maybe... he had a girlfriend, but I don't know. But my father has no enemies! He's a good man. And no debts, if that's what you mean.~
@390 = ~Rosie, we need to figure out first where Peter could have gone after he got off the ship. Could it have been another tavern? The Copper Coronet, for example?~
@391 = ~Possibly. Although usually he and I only went between the ones I named... I'm afraid to go to other taverns alone. But when I came here, I looked into the Copper Coronet and described my father's appearance. The innkeeper told me...~
@392 = ~*Rosie strikes a theatrical pose and very closely imitates Bernard*: "Ah, girl, looking for a non-regular, unremarkable person in such a busy tavern is a lost cause. "I'll just say that we haven't had anything interesting involving sailors in the last three days."~
@393 = ~That could be the answer we'd get in any other tavern. Think about it, maybe your father decided to spend his salary somewhere else?~
@394 = ~*thoughtfully* The only place... Yes. He always brought me gifts from his travels. But sometimes I'd find that some of the things were made here in Amn, and not in some distant land. I didn't show it, I was happy with any gift, since I wasn't really used to that. After all, I'm an orphan and I used to live in an orphanage.~
@395 = ~So Peter could have gone to buy you a gift. In that case, he could have been last seen on the Promenade.~
@396 = ~Oh, yes! How could I not have thought of that... Thank you, <CHARNAME>! Shall we go?~
@397 = ~Yeah, why waste time.~
@398 = ~Hurray, full speed ahead!~
@399 = ~Wait a bit.~
@400 = ~Okay, but let's hurry up, okay?~
@401 = ~Listen, this is turning out to be a bit of a tedious task. I guess I shouldn't have taken it on.~
@402 = ~There you go! And I believed you... Oh well, I can handle it myself.~
@403 = ~Wait, first we need to decide which of the merchants we'll talk to there. What do you like best among gifts?~
@404 = ~Books, of course! I'm a future bard, I love fascinating stories.~
@405 = ~I get it. Then let's start with Galump.~ // Galump - SHOP08.DLG
@406 = ~Oh yeah! And by the way, he sometimes sells very interesting books. Then let's go to him.~
@407 = ~They say that Enge has all sorts of goods for sale.~
@408 = ~Hmm... yeah, but I don't think I've seen books there before.~
@409 = ~Ribald's shop sells a lot of things, including various scrolls. Maybe they have books too?~
@410 = ~Oh, well, my father definitely wouldn't buy me a present at Ribald's shop. Everything there is very expensive!~
// Galump
@411 = ~Want to buy something, little one? I have a new book from the very popular "Conversations with a Ghost" series. It's in great demand among girls your age.~
@412 = ~Oh... yes. I would like to... but that's not why I'm here. I'm looking for my missing father... but he's a human, not a halfling. He's a sailor and...~
@413 = ~A sailor? A sailor?! Not long ago, a guy who called himself a sailor and bought a book for his daughter from me was snatched away by a demon right before my eyes! To think that this demon was sneaking up on me at first! Oh, you better go away, I don't even want to remember that.~
@414 = ~W-what? Dad was snatched away by a demon?! In broad daylight, in front of everyone?~
@415 = ~Yeah, yeah. Go away and don't bother me. Otherwise, after such conversations, the demon might even decide to come back... Back off.~
@416 = ~*With tears in her eyes* <CHARNAME>, what should I do?~
@417 = ~Don't be upset, Rosie, we'll try to figure everything out now.~
@418 = ~Thank you!~
@419 = ~We didn't agree that we'd have to deal with demons. Sorry, but let's end it here.~
@420 = ~Oh, I see! So know that I'll find that demon and save daddy alone! Goodbye.~
@421 = ~My dear fellow, whether you like it or not, you'll have to tell me a little more about that demon. Otherwise, you'll get into the trouble you're trying to avoid. The demon is out of nowhere, and the trouble is right in front of you.~
@422 = ~Okay, buddy. You'll answer my questions right now. And if you don't want to, the demon will seem like a trifle to you compared to me.~
@423 = ~About that demon... It seems to me that you've got something mixed up. Maybe it wasn't a demon at all, but... something else? Admit it - it's possible that you're mistaken. Tell me everything, it won't make things worse. I'll try to figure out what this demon is, whatever it is.~
@424 = ~Aren't you ashamed? The girl is looking for her father, and you don't want to help her, shaking like a hare. Go on, tell me what you know. If the demon suddenly appears, I'll drive it away.~
@425 = ~I wonder how much gold drives away the fear of demons?~
@426 = ~Well... okay... but I don't really have anything to say. That day, business was going well, there were many buyers. I heard a sailor telling someone that he had just returned from a voyage and was looking for gifts for his daughter. Then I bought a book. And then...~
@427 = ~The demon appeared before me! He stared at me with his golden eyes, from which flames burst forth! His horns reached the sky! I screamed. The guards rushed towards us.~
@428 = ~And... I don't know what happened next, because I closed my eyes, expecting the demon to swallow me now. And when I opened my eyes - the demon was already dragging the unfortunate sailor along. Over there... *he points towards the "Den of the Seven Vales"*~
@429 = ~A strange story... Okay, thanks for telling me everything. Good luck with your trade.~
@430 = ~Well done, you got off cheap. And I hope you didn't lie to me. Okay, goodbye.~
@431 = ~Interesting... I'll go look for that demon.~
@432 = ~*Rosie runs away to the "Den of the Seven Vales" alone out of impatience*~
//Den of the Seven Vales
@433 = ~It looks like the demon isn't here. But I won't be the one asking questions, since you're the one investigating.~
@434 = ~Hm... Sorry if this sounds weird... But have you seen a demon around here?~
@435 = ~A demon? Hahaha... Poor Lady Zarina, has she been seen without her hood after all? Yeah, she comes here sometimes, she likes to chat with me over a glass of wine.~
@436 = ~Has a demon stopped by for a beer? Looks like he was planning on having a sailor for a snack.~
@437 = ~A demon? Hahaha... Poor Lady Zarina, has she been seen without her hood after all? Well, yes, she comes here sometimes, but she doesn't drink beer and, I assure you, she doesn't eat sailors.~
@438 = ~Lady Zarina?~
@439 = ~You need to explain yourself... what kind of acquaintance do you have with demons?~
@440 = ~Lady Zarina Arneli - she's not a demon. She just had the bad luck of being born a tiefling.~
@441 = ~Tiefling? A creature with a quarter of demonic blood in it? And this... Lady Zarina...~
@442 = ~Tiefling?~
@443 = ~Oh, she's a perfectly harmless creature. Though not for young men, if you know what I mean... I hope you won't harm her?~
@444 = ~Well, yes, a tiefling. It's the descendant of a demon, if I'm not mistaken, it has a quarter of demonic blood in it. But Lady Zarina is a harmless creature. Not for young men, though, if you know what I mean... I hope you won't hurt her?~
@445 = ~I just need to figure out what's going on.~
@446 = ~We'll see. I don't know what I'll have to deal with yet.~
@447 = ~Well, it's up to me what I do.~
@448 = ~Okay. Lady Zarina's business is none of my business, after all. I hope you'll stop by here again for a beer once you've figured it out.~
@449 = ~Now... Zarina's here on the second floor. I'll call her now.~
// Zarina and Rosie
@450 = ~Good day... or bad... depending on what day it is. But I'm glad to meet a new friend any day.~
@451 = ~(Before you is a lovely young woman with refined features. She is wearing a floor-length cloak with a very large hood. Inhuman, completely golden, white-less eyes sparkle with curiosity. Beautifully outlined lips are frozen in a strange half-smile. Chestnut hair escapes from behind the hood in light rings. Her movements are sometimes calm and smooth, sometimes swift and impetuous, but always graceful)~
@452 = ~*The halfling girl looks at the tiefling, her eyes wide open*~
@453 = ~Uh... I... oh! So you are Lady Zarina Arneli? And you are not a demon?~
@454 = ~Oh, child, you too... I am not sure that the demons - for their part - will gladly acknowledge my kinship with them. If I could summon them - there would be something to talk about. But no matter how much my mother taught me wisdom and reason - alas!~
@455 = ~The scroll merchant complained that he was attacked by a creature with golden eyes and huge horns... which you have under your hood, right? What if you showed them to the demons as proof of kinship with them?~
@456 = ~*Laughs* I can also show a tail, young lady. The main thing is that my dear relatives do not show me fangs and claws in response, which I do not have.~
@457 = ~*trying to look brave* If the merchant told the truth, then you must know where my father is! Did you do something to him? Answer!~
@458 = ~The most boring thing you can do to a living creature is kill it. So even if I had "done something", your father - your adopted father, right? - would certainly have survived. But I did nothing. On the contrary, this brave man took me under his protection when the idiot merchant called the guards.~
@459 = ~So you... know your father? And you know me?~
@460 = ~Not at all. We just talked for a while... I saw the sailor buy a little dress, and then we both went to the book and scroll merchant. Your father said that he was buying gifts for his beloved daughter, and asked me what books almost grown-up girls read these days. I was surprised then - the dress was not for an "almost grown-up". However, he was talking about only one daughter. Now I see you, and it all makes sense.~
@461 = ~So that's how it is... and then what happened?~
@462 = ~And then a gust of wind tore the hood off my head, and the merchant screamed wildly. Nothing new. But your father stood up for me, offered me his hand and led me to the tavern. Apparently, he has an idea of who tieflings are. He didn't leave, he stayed there for a drink, and I saw a sailor from the ship "Evil Eye" sit down with him.~
@463 = ~Do you know this sailor?~
@464 = ~I don't know him either. But a ship with that name is moored at the pier in the Docks, and that guy has a tattoo of this same evil eye on his arm.~
@465 = ~And then?~
@466 = ~And then I chatted with the barmaid, drank my ale and left. The sailors were still drinking and talking - I don't know about what, I wasn't listening to their conversation. There was a bottle of some black liquid on their table. That's all.~
@467 = ~Oh... th-thank you... Lady Zarina. Seven feet under the keel... Can I ask another question?~
@468 = ~Of course, young lady.~
@469 = ~*Animatedly* You said that the most boring thing you can do to a living creature is kill it. What's the most interesting thing?~
@470 = ~*shrugging* It depends on the person. For me, it's to make friends with him, I guess. There's nothing more interesting than friendship.~
@471 = ~What about love?~
@472 = ~Love is exciting, but fleeting. However, I will not discuss this topic with a child.~
@473 = ~I am not a child!~
@474 = ~Perhaps... in a sense.~
@475 = ~And what book did you advise my father to buy for me?~
@476 = ~The new volume of "Conversations with a Ghost"... But that is the second question, child. May I ask one of them?~
@477 = ~Oh, I am a little scared...~
@478 = ~*laughs* Really? I just wanted to ask if you would like to keep me informed of what happens? After all, you are going to look for the sailor from "Evil Eye", right? I was curious how this story will end.~
@479 = ~Of course, let's go! I mean... Oh! What time is it? I almost forgot - I promised to sing for the guests at "Gifts of the Sea" today! I'm running, I'm already late. I'm going full steam ahead! <CHARNAME>, let's meet there, I'll be waiting for you. Come back when you hear something.~
@480 = ~I'll go with you, Rosie. I want to hear you sing. And of course, I want to hear the rest of the story.~
@481 = ~Uh... you're welcome.~
@482 = ~Thank you. By the way, <CHARNAME>, it was very nice to meet you.~
// Sailor from "Evil Eye"
@483 = ~*You see a middle-aged man with a weathered face, he seems worried about something. On his arm is the tattoo that Zarina told you about.*~
@484 = ~Er? Hm...~
@485 = ~Hello. Can we chat a little?~
@486 = ~Hey, buddy! We need to talk.~
@487 = ~Listen here... We have something to talk about.~
@488 = ~*The sailor gives you a dark, sideways look*~
@489 = ~Leave me alone. We have nothing to chat about.~
@490 = ~Why are you so unfriendly? I just want to ask one question... ~
@491 = ~Okay, calm down. Whether you like it or not, we'll have to talk.~
@492 = ~Shut up and listen to what I'm telling you...~
@493 = ~*The sailor mutters something under his breath and tries to leave, but you block his way*~
@494 = ~Believe me, I don't want to bother you, but this is important. You were drinking with a sailor from the schooner "Swift" at the "Den of the Seven Vales", right? And it looks like you were the last one to talk to him before he disappeared. Tell me what you talked about.~
@495 = ~You were seen at the "Den of the Seven Vales" tavern, drinking some black swill with a sailor from the schooner "Swift". Now he's gone missing. Come on, tell me everything you know.~
@496 = ~Stop! I am the head of the Athkatla Detective Guild, on duty! Quickly tell me what you know about the missing sailor from the schooner "Bystryaya".~
@497 = ~Okay, okay... Let's say I do know where the guy went. But there was no evil intent. We just shared a nice drink. And then... we both... well, decided to play dice... And I lost... my fiancee.~
@498 = ~Are you kidding me? It would be better if I told you the TRUTH!~
@499 = ~I'd be happy to giggle with you, but this is no joke.~
@500 = ~Eh... well, that's sad... I guess? What happened next?~
@501 = ~Actually, I vaguely remember, but...~
@502 = ~Ha-ha-ha! Lost your fiancee? You're a gambling man.~
@503 = ~Say - a fool, the likes of which the world has never seen. I didn't even ask that guy's name!~
@504 = ~It's crazy what an idiot I'm talking to.~
@505 = ~I would say a few sweet words in response, but it's hard to disagree with you. We both got drunk to the point of squealing like pigs.~
@506 = ~Then I loaded him into a wagon train that was heading to the Umar Hills. I'd never been there myself, Melanie and I met here in Athkatla, and then we wrote letters to each other.~
@507 = ~And so, having returned from sailing, I finally got ready to visit her in the village, but... We were too drunk. Anyway, now this guy I gave all of Melanie's letters to has probably met her there in the Umar Hills...~
@508 = ~I can imagine! Well, I hope she didn't kill him... I see, now I know what to do.~
@509 = ~Sent a dead drunk Peter to meet his new fiancee? What a surprise for his daughter! What if this Melanie doesn't care who she marries? We need to figure this out...~
@510 = ~Listen, buddy. If you got so drunk and got rid of this connection so easily, then somewhere deep down you just didn't want to marry Melanie. Freedom is more important to you, it seems.~
@511 = ~There are people like that... I hope Peter really wasn't thinking straight at that moment. And maybe this misunderstanding has already been cleared up, but we need to make sure. The Umar Hills, you say...~
@512 = ~Okay, I told you the whole truth. As shameful as it is, I didn't lie. I hope Melanie will be happy one way or another, and I'll forget about this whole story. My, my heart feels better now...~
@513 = ~Bye, groom...~
@514 = ~Okay, thanks for the story.~
@515 = ~Congratulations on keeping your freedom!~
@516 = ~*The sailor leaves. After thinking about it, you decide that this is not the most pleasant situation, and before you inform Rosie, you should first sort things out. So, it's time to visit the Umar Hills and ask the local innkeepers - they probably know something.*~
// Inn in the Umar Hills
@517 = ~Oh, hello, hello! Come in and have a seat. Are you interested in what's going on here?~
@518 = ~Not now... I'm looking for a sailor from Athkatla. He was supposed to come to you with one of the supply trains.~
@519 = ~Sailor? He certainly didn't stop by my place. You know, supply trains come in at night... People do their business and then go their separate ways. No one can keep track of everyone who comes.~
@520 = ~What about a girl named Melanie?~
@521 = ~Heh heh... She's not much of a girl, if you know what I mean. Mel lives here at the inn. She's definitely had a few suitors, but it's never gotten to the point of marriage.~
@522 = ~Where is she now?~
@523 = ~She just recently went off somewhere. Stopped in for a sip of ale before heading out, and then left. Maybe she'll be back by evening. I really hope so! She left her pet rat in the room! She's only had it for a short time.~
@524 = ~That rat is strange... I don't even understand what's wrong with that beast. I hope Mel comes back for it or I'll have to set a couple of cats on it.~
@525 = ~I want to take a look at that rat.~
@526 = ~Really? I'd be happy to get rid of it, a rat in a tavern is a bad omen. And if Melanie comes back for her, I'll say she ran away...~
@527 = ~Agreed.~
@528 = ~Okay, I'll bring her now... She's in the cage.~
@529 = ~Here, take it. *Hands you the cage with the rat. You really see something strange in the rat's eyes... As if she knows more than she seems, but can't say.*~
// Temples
@530 = ~Can you check what's wrong with this rat? I think there's some kind of spell on her.~
@531 = ~It looks like that's it! But we'll fix it. Just a minute...~
// Peter Gold
@532 = ~Oh... is it really... me again? Thank you for your help! Thank you... Oh, my daughter must have been worried sick!~
@533 = ~Everything's fine now, don't worry. Tell me what happened to you.~
@534 = ~Let's get down to business quickly. Tell me what happened.~
@535 = ~Well, you won't get off with just "thank you"... Okay, spill the beans.~
@536 = ~Yeah... right now... This is the weirdest thing that's ever happened to me in my entire life! I never thought I'd be kidnapped by a woman... ~
@537 = ~I had a drink with old Harry, and I woke up in a carriage... tied up! The driver told me not to struggle when I swore. That I now belonged to "Mistress Melanie". I decided to wait until I met this Melanie. There was one fear - that she might turn out to be a witch.~
@538 = ~Let me guess - that's what happened?~
@539 = ~Alas, your fears were justified.~
@540 = ~Some men think that any woman is a witch, heh-heh. But can this one really do magic?~
@541 = ~You see what she did to me. You see - she was waiting for Harry! She said it like she spat it out: "I communicated in letters with a completely different person! He has such interesting memories..." I don't know what my friend recalled in his correspondence with this witch, but she was wildly angry at the deception. And she turned me into a rat.~
@542 = ~Kept me locked up like a tame animal, but, fortunately, she abandoned me in the room, having gone somewhere on her own business. What a shame! Ah... I'm in your debt for the rest of my life, but for now, take this... May your evening always be only passing. And I'll rush to hug my Rosie! Maybe we'll see each other again.~
@543 = ~*You think about this case a lot. It looks like a love affair, but your instinct tells you that something is wrong here. And life may yet bring you together with the witch Melanie, who needs "interesting memories" from men. But be that as it may, for now we can congratulate the guild on a successfully completed case!*~
// Rosie and Zarina
@544 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>! Thank you so much! Thanks to you and your guild, my father is back with me, safe and sound!~
@545 = ~I'm in your debt, my friend.~
@546 = ~That was an interesting story, I must admit. And Rosie turned out to be a pretty good singer, too.~
@547 = ~Okay, Rosie Gold, the detective guild will take on this case... As a paladin, I'm obliged to help in such a situation.~
@548 = ~Sorry, but we are not ready to help you. The detective guild has other, more important matters.~
@549 = ~Okay, I'll go and find my father myself! Goodbye.~
@550 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>! Well, shall we go to the Promenade? I need to find my father!~
@551 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>! Any news about my father yet?~
@552 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>! May good fortune be with you, no matter how long the journey.~
@553 = ~Rosie, your father went to the Umar Hills in search of a woman named Melanie. But the trail went cold after that. Melanie herself had already left the village and we couldn't find her. I'm sorry, but I can't help you any further.~
@554 = ~Ah... Well, at least that clears things up. Then I'll go to the Umar Hills myself and look for my father. I have to find him, no matter the cost. Thank you! Here's 200 coins for your efforts.~

@555 = ~What a stupid story that turned out to be. But something tells me that not everything is so simple. We never found this witch... However, do we need it?~
@556 = ~In my opinion, what happened to Peter is very instructive. Irresponsibility and frivolity lead to big problems.~
@557 = ~You must always be true to yourself, your family and duty - and then nothing like this would have happened to him. But the main thing is that everything ended well.~
@558 = ~You could write a ballad about this story. Listeners always appreciate songs about love... and about other people's stupidity.~
@559 = ~This is what excess emotions and alcohol lead to. This Peter is a real fool. He's lucky to have such a devoted daughter. Without her, we wouldn't have come to the rescue, and he would have remained a rat forever.~
@560 = ~Another glorious feat of the great Sir Garrick!~
@561 = ~The great Tiax spent a lot of effort saving this idiot sailor, and he didn't even give him a worthy reward! He deserves a hundred lashes for this!~
@562 = ~What a touching and funny story it turned out to be! It's good that we were able to help this family!~
@563 = ~Bah! Are we going to keep helping all sorts of fools?~
@564 = ~What a stupid waste of time! (And, most importantly, no one asked my advice during all this time! As if these fools can cope without me.)~
@565 = ~It wasn't worth disenchanting him. He made a fine rat, perfect for scientific experiments, and would be useful around the house.~
@566 = ~All that talk, and not a single decent fight! Ugh!~
// Temples
@567 = ~Rats are not allowed in the temple! Get that thing out of here!~
@568 = ~Hmm, interesting... I do sense some strong magic here. Let's see...~
// Additions
@569 = ~It looks like we won't find anything else. Peter most likely went somewhere with Melanie, or is already dead. (We need to get back to Rosie and tell her what we've learned).~
@570 = ~As you wish.~
@571 = ~Not yet.~
@572 = ~I believe he's alive! Please find him!~
@573 = ~We need to talk to Galump. I didn't ask anything yet, I was waiting for you!~
@574 = ~The head of the Detective guild?... Okay, okay... Let's say I really do know where that guy went. But there was no evil intent. We just treated ourselves to a nice drink. And then... we both... well, decided to play dice... And I lost... my fiancee.~
