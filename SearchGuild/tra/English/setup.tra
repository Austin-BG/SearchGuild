Here is what the Counsul of Six has set down and approve... ...what we hereby establish, with the approval of the Gods and the acceptance of the people of Athkatla.Now, in the year 1365 Alturiak 15, a small guild called the Guild of Detectives has been approved and endorsed by the City Council of Athkatla and by Us.
Given that maintaining peace in our country has been challenging, we have been unable, so far, to achieve our desired result due to criminals who have evaded capture and been pursued with limited success. We therefore decree that the authorities of Amn will provide the guild with every assistance, and that in return we ask that the guild will also assist the authorities in any way they can in capturing an outlaws.
The Guild is to be ready, for the opportunity to assist the city guard or executive officer by pursuing and arresting criminals wherever they may be hiding.
The Guild is now allowed to deal with the citizens of Amn, investigate and engage in other matters related to the inquiries...
The guild is required to pay taxes in the amounts prescribed by the Small Guilds Act...

In this short manuscript, in the hand of Adelard the Wanderer, the first head of the Atkatla Detective Guild, the most important principles of crime investigation are recorded. The handwriting in the manuscript is large and elegant, but not legible due to the sheer number of patterns, scrolls, and other embellishments on the letters. 

‘Five rules to assist the inquisitor:

1. Listen carefully
...to everyone involved, pay attention to any, even the most insignificant trifles - everything you hear will definitely be useful to you in the future.

2. Take notes
...about what you learnt during the investigation: key places, witnesses, chronology of events. It is always best to think that your memory is not as reliable as you would like it to be.

3. Look for clues
...they always remain, even if you don't see them at first. Act as quickly as possible while the trail is still fresh.

4. Build your case
...based on what you have learned, build a version of what happened that can answer the questions: who, what, when, and (most importantly!) why committed the crime. Avoid unsupported hypotheses.

5. Narrow down the suspect pool
...but cross off only those whose alibis are flawless. And pray Helm that your net is strong and the last fish in it is the criminal.’~

@47 = ~Through this window you can see the Slums teeming with life: a constant stream of scavengers, tramps, peddlers, junk dealers, chimney sweeps, dockers and other workers of all races and genders - the City's labour army doing its hardest, dirtiest work.~

Master!
My writing is still bad... the pen is flimsy, it breaks, makes blots. Numa is angry that I ruined a lot of parchments. So my little by little steals this one to write.

We are doing well, there is a lot of work, we catch a lot of criminals and expand the guild. We still have to finish off our competitors - bounty hunters, they now sit quietly and fear us.

My pay is good, so I can buy any books I want. A new one came out, about a brave robber baron, very interesting.

I miss you all, Master, my most. Finish your business and return to the guild quickly.

@1000 = ~Clearing the basement

There's slime occupied the guild basement. Nordic says it's the work of a mage named ‘Narrrciliss’. He sounds a lot like that weird scientist from the Valley of the Tombs.~

@1001 = ~Clearing the basement

The guild basement has been safely cleared of slime. But I don't think Nordic will be coming back to live here. He deserves more for his valor service.~

@1002 = ~Clearing the basement

The guild basement has been safely cleared. But Nordic fell in that battle. The guild has lost its soul with his death, and there is no reason for us to stay here any longer.~

@1003 = ~The Detective Guild

I'm sorry I was unable to help Nordic. I'm afraid it's all over for the Detective Guild, now the authorities are going to take it away for debt.~

@1004 = ~The Detective Guild

I decided to try and help Nordic with the Guild. We have exactly TWO weeks to do this, otherwise the guild will be closed for debts. We need to find the code to a desk containing important documents. It seems that the key is some kind of date. But what is it? It looks like we need to type the month first, then the year. I have a few dates that work: 1363, the year Adelard's wife died, 1359, the year he married, and finally 1365, the year Adelard founded the guild. But maybe there's something else we've missed.~

@1005 = ~The Detective Guild

Nordic said there are councillors in the Government District who know about the law. Now that we have the papers on the Guild, we should pay them a visit. If we don't manage to resolve the issue within two weeks, the guild will be closed.~

@1006 = ~The Detective Guild

I managed to defend the Detective Guild and become its new leader. I don't know if I chose wisely, but we'll see. At least there's one more happy bugbear in the world.~

@1007 = ~The Case of the Enchanted Dog

I need to find a mysterious dog named Sultan, who belongs to the powerful horse breeding family of Crowmerdown. Sultan, I was told, was possessed by a demon. Apparently, the dog growled the name of the Lord of Dawn - which means that the first thing I need to do is check the Temple of Lathander.~

@1008 = ~The Case of the Enchanted Dog

Sultan was clearly possessed. I decided not to interfere, and let the Knights of Dawn solve my problem themselves.~

@1009 = ~The Case of the Enchanted Dog

The ritual was successful. The demon was banished to his home plane... I guess. Sultan returns home, safe and sound.~

@1010 = ~A Scroll for Mr. Matty

Matthias Nanstorp, a young Justice Advisor, came to the guild. He asked for help in retrieving a scroll from the ship "Pinky Vixen" docked in Athkatla. It is of great importance for his investigation into local corruption. We need to look for a sailor from this ship in the Docks and try to negotiate with him to let us on board.~

@1011 = ~A Scroll for Mr. Matty

We agreed with a sailor named Trump that he would let us on board the "Pinky Vixen", but he asks for 100 gold for it. Once we have collected this money, we need to return to him.~

@1012 = ~A Scroll for Mr. Matty

We helped Mr. Matthias study the scroll that interested him, and he learned a lot of interesting things... And we received the promised payment. Everyone is happy.~

@1013 = ~The missing dagger

Numa and I decided to send Rushdie into the sewers to search for the lost halfling family dagger. The search will take him one day.~

@1014 = ~The missing dagger

Rushdie has already returned to the guild. He found the lost dagger in the sewers. Numa informed the client that the task was successfully completed.~

@1015 = ~Can't trust anyone?

We gave shelter to an orc thief named Drangolona in the detective guild, but she (as expected) soon fled, taking the guild's money with her. Maybe we'll meet her again. Maybe not.~

@1016 = ~Honey Gambit

A dwarf named Frodo Pumkins has come to the detective guild after a competitor stole his family pie recipe right before a baking competition. Frodo has an idea to outwit him, but he needs my help. I need to meet both dwarves at Enge's shop on the Promenade.~

@1017 = ~Honey Gambit

Frodo won the baking competition and got a job at the Dragon Restaurant. In large part because he managed to outwit his competitor, Mydrik.~
